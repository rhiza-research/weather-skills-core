"""Lint-target layout detection and cross-skill corpus resolution.

The lint target resolves to one or more skill directories by layout
auto-detection. The cross-skill corpus is the target's own tree, plus upward
discovery when the target is a single skill inside an enclosing skills tree
(siblings are context only: findings are reported for the target alone), plus
every ``--against`` value -- a local path or a GitHub repository reference.

A GitHub reference is fetched shallowly (blob-filtered and sparse) into a
temporary directory that only the declaration files are read from and that is
removed when the lint run ends; no clone is retained and no credentials are
used (public repositories only). A branch or tag revision is fetched with
``git clone --branch``; a commit SHA is fetched with ``git init`` + ``git
fetch --depth 1 origin <sha>`` + ``git checkout FETCH_HEAD``, because ``git
clone --branch`` accepts only branch and tag names.
