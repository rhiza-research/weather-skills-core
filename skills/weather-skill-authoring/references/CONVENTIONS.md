# CLI flag conventions

Skills in this repo are independent single-file scripts that declare their CLI
through the `@weather_skill` decorator from `weather_skills_core`, and they
often expose the same conceptual parameter. To make skills easy to compose and
easy to work on, **a flag that does the same thing on different skills must
have the same name**.

This document is the canonical mapping. Standard flags (`--input`/`--output`,
`--start`/`--end`/`--date`, `--bbox`, `--variable`, `--workers`, `--title`,
`--dims`, `--time-dim`) come from the declaration's toggles; every other flag
is declared under `extra_args`, and this table is normative for those names.
When you add or change a CLI, match these names. New concepts that aren't
covered here should be added to this file in the same PR that introduces them.

The weather-skills-core conformance linter checks `extra_args` flag naming and
shape across skills: WSK101 flags an extra argument that shadows a standard
parameter, WSK201 flags a one-off flag name declared by more than one skill, and
WSK202 flags a shared flag name whose shape diverges between skills. The
forecasting-skills CI runs this linter as an advisory check on the skills changed
in a pull request, posting the findings as a sticky comment; it does not block
merge, so the naming convention is upheld by that advisory check together with
review.

## Canonical names

### Inputs and outputs

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Single input Zarr | `--input` / `-i` | path | Required for skills that consume one Zarr. |
| Single output | `--output` / `-o` | path | Required for skills that produce a Zarr or other artifact. |
| Multiple inputs | `--input` / `-i`, repeated | path | Repeat the flag once per input: `-i a.zarr -i b.zarr`. Order is preserved. Skills that compare or concatenate multiple Zarrs use this form. |
| Two semantically named inputs | use a domain name (e.g. `--forecast`, `--mclimate`) | path | Use named flags only when the inputs have fixed, non-interchangeable roles AND the role name carries meaning. For symmetric or arbitrary inputs (concat, plot-compare), use `--input` repeated. |

### Region and bounding box

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit bbox | `--bbox` | `N/W/S/E` decimal degrees | Slash-separated four floats. The canonical way to spatially restrict a skill. To get a country's bbox, resolve it with the `resolve-region` skill. |
| Country code (resolve input) | positional `<CODE>` | ISO 3166-1 alpha-3, uppercase | `resolve-region`'s positional argument. The script does an exact `iso3` → geometry lookup; mapping a free-text place name to the code is the agent's job. |
| Boundary polygon output | `--geojson` | path | `resolve-region` output: writes the resolved country's boundary polygon as a single-feature GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`. |
| Polygon-mask input | `--mask-geojson` | path | A GeoJSON boundary polygon used to NaN-mask gridded cells outside it. Used by `plot` and `plot-compare`; feed it `resolve-region`'s `--geojson` output. |

### Time

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Date range | `--start` / `--end` | relative-or-absolute date token (see grammar below); both ends inclusive | Used by archive fetchers covering a span of dates. |
| Single date | `--date` | relative-or-absolute date token (see grammar below) | Used when a skill operates on one timestamp (e.g. an init date for a forecast). |
| Target CF calendar | `--calendar` | CF calendar name | Calendar to convert the time axis onto (e.g. `standard`, `proleptic_gregorian`, `noleap`, `360_day`, `all_leap`, `julian`). Used by `convert-calendar`. |
| Calendar alignment mode | `--align-on` | `date` \| `year` | How `convert-calendar` maps dates across calendars. Required whenever the source or target calendar is `360_day`. `year` translates by relative position in the year (best for daily/sub-daily); `date` conserves month/day and drops invalid dates (best for coarser-than-daily). |

#### Relative-or-absolute date grammar

`--start`, `--end`, and `--date` accept the **same** value grammar on every
fetcher. A value is one of:

- an absolute ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`;
- `now` or `today` — the current UTC date;
- `latest` — the newest date with available data, discovered per source
  (imerg: max available granule date; chirps: backward HTTPS day-probe; tahmo:
  max returned observation date over a bounded lookback; ecmwf: newest
  accessible forecast init — embargoed (access-restricted) recent inits are
  skipped);
- an offset `now-<int>{d|w}` or `latest-<int>{d|w}` — the base minus N (`w` = 7
  days, so `3w` = 21 days). The offset count is capped (36525 days). Future `+`
  offsets, month/year units, and anything else are rejected with a non-zero exit
  **before any network call**.

Boundary handling for `--start`/`--end`: absolute endpoints and ordinary
relative ranges are **inclusive of both ends**. The one exception is the
**duration idiom** — start is `B-<int>{d|w}` and end is exactly the same base
token `B` (both `now`, or both `latest`): the window is exactly N days, inclusive
of `B`, with the far edge shifted in by one (so `latest-3w .. latest` →
`[latest-20d, latest]` = 21 days incl. `latest`; `now-1w .. now` → 7 days).
Tokens stay literal — `latest-3w` always means `latest − 21d`; only the
`B-N .. B` shape moves the far edge. After resolution, `start <= end` or the run
exits non-zero (pre-network).

This section is the grammar's normative definition; its implementation lives
in `weather_skills_core` (the decorator's `start_time`/`end_time`/`date`
toggles), whose test suite enforces it. Each script supplies only its
per-source `latest` resolver. `latest` discovery runs at most once per
invocation and only when a token references `latest`; an all-absolute or
`now`-only window performs no discovery call. The cache key /
`weather_skills_history` args record the **resolved
absolute dates**, never the relative token. For any invocation containing a
relative token, the script prints a stderr line before fetching with the
resolved concrete dates, the day count, and the boundary mode and its reason.

### Variables and dimensions

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Variable selector | `--variable` / `-v` | string | Restricts an operation to one data variable in a multi-variable Zarr. Repeat once per variable to select several. |
| Target units | `--to-units` | UDUNITS/CF units string | The units to convert a variable's values to; becomes the output variable's `units` attr. Used by `unit-convert`. |
| CF standard name | `--standard-name` | CF standard_name string | The CF `standard_name` to write on the output variable, overriding any inferred value. Used by `unit-convert` to keep `standard_name` consistent with converted units. |
| New variable name | `--to-name` | string | The name to rename a data variable TO. Becomes the output variable's name. Used by `rename`. |
| Per-input variable selector | `--variable-a` / `--variable-b` | string | Selects the variable for each input independently when a skill compares two inputs that may hold different variables. Used by `plot-compare`. Precedence per row: `--variable-a`/`-b`, then `--variable`, then that input's first real data var. |
| Catalog dataset selector | `--dataset` | string | Names which dataset to fetch from a multi-dataset source catalog. Validated at runtime against the source's own listing (e.g. `dynamical-fetch` checks `dynamical_catalog.list()`); an unknown id prints the valid list and exits. Used by fetchers that front a catalog of datasets rather than a single product. |
| Operation dim | `--dim` | string; repeatable where noted | Names the dimension an operation acts along. `concat` takes it once (the axis to concatenate along); `reduce` repeats it once per dim to collapse. |
| Spatial dim-name override | `--dims` | `LAT,LON` | Comma-separated names of the latitude and longitude dims when they're not auto-detectable. |
| Time-dim override | `--time-dim` | string | Name of the time-like dim when not auto-detectable. Distinct from `--dims`, which is spatial only. |
| Overpass selector | `--overpass` | string from a per-skill fixed list | Which satellite half-orbit overpass to read when a product splits ascending/descending passes (e.g. `smap-fetch` uses `choices={AM, PM}`: AM = ~6am descending, PM = ~6pm ascending). |

### Catalog facet selectors

Some sources are catalogs faceted along several axes rather than a single
dataset id. A fetcher fronting such a catalog (e.g. `cmip6-fetch`) resolves a
single store from these facet flags. Reuse these names; add new ones here.

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model / source | `--model` | string | The source model id (CMIP6 `source_id`). |
| Experiment / scenario | `--experiment` | string | The experiment or scenario id (CMIP6 `experiment_id`, e.g. `historical`, `ssp245`). |
| Ensemble member | `--member` | string | The ensemble member / variant id (CMIP6 `member_id`, e.g. `r1i1p1f1`). |
| Catalog table / frequency | `--table` | string | The catalog table id that fixes the variable's frequency/realm (CMIP6 `table_id`, e.g. `Amon`, `day`). |
| Grid label | `--grid` | string | The catalog grid label (CMIP6 `grid_label`, e.g. `gn`, `gr1`). Required only when more than one matches the other facets. |

When the catalog stores one variable per dataset (CMIP6), `--variable`/`-v`
selects that variable facet (and is the output variable).

### Reductions and rendering

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit dim reduction | `--reduce` | string, repeatable | Names a non-time dim to mean-reduce before producing a 1-D output. Repeat once per dim (`--reduce number --reduce latitude --reduce longitude`). Required (rather than silently averaging) when an input still has non-time dims after `--variable` selection. |
| Day-of-year alignment | `--align-day-of-year` | boolean flag | Used by `plot-timeseries`: plots each trace against its day-of-year so inputs from different years overlay on a shared x-axis. Requires a calendar-date time axis. |
| Figure title | `--title` | string | Optional figure title. Used by `plot`, `plot-compare`, `plot-mediogram`, and `plot-timeseries`. |
| Colormap | `--colormap` | string | matplotlib colormap name. Used by `plot-compare` (when omitted in shared-scale mode, the categorical precipitation colormap with `BoundaryNorm` is used). |
| Per-input colormap | `--colormap-a` / `--colormap-b` | string | matplotlib colormap for each input independently in `plot-compare`'s independent-scale mode. Precedence per row: `--colormap-a`/`-b`, then `--colormap`, then `viridis`. |
| Color-scale mode | `--shared-scale` / `--independent-scale` | flag (mutually exclusive) | Forces one shared color scale across both rows, or a per-row scale + colorbar. Used by `plot-compare`. Default: shared when both rows resolve to the same variable AND matching units, else independent. |
| Output view | `--format` | `human` \| `json` \| `script` | Selects how a read-only inspector renders its result. Used by `provenance`: `human` lineage, raw `json` chain, or a runnable reproduction `script`. |

### Thresholds and comparisons

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Comparison threshold | `--threshold` | float | Scalar value compared against each element, in the target variable's own units. No unit conversion happens — use `unit-convert` upstream if the input isn't already in the desired units. Used by `exceedance-probability`. |
| Comparison operator | `--comparison` | `gt` \| `ge` \| `lt` \| `le` | Which comparison to apply as `value <op> threshold`. Used by `exceedance-probability`. |

### Spatial grid targets

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Refinement/coarsening factor | `--factor` / `-f` | int | Integer grid factor. For `downscale` (finer-or-equal): factor must be an integer `>= 1`; new spacing = input spacing / factor (factor 1 = identity). |
| Target grid spacing | `--target-resolution` | float (degrees) | Target grid spacing in degrees. For `downscale` it must be finer-or-equal (`<=`) to the input on each axis; for `coarsen` it must be coarser-or-equal (`>=`) on each axis. Equal resolution is a valid no-op in both. |
| Grid offset | `--offset` | float (degrees) | Used by `coarsen`: target points fall at `offset + k*resolution`. |
| Reference-grid target | `--reference-grid` | path | Path to a Zarr whose lat/lon grid defines the target grid. Used by `downscale` to match another dataset's (finer-or-equal) grid. |
| Downscaling algorithm | `--algorithm` | string from a per-skill fixed list | Which downscaling algorithm adds information when going finer. `downscale` uses `choices={linear-interpolation, q-q}`. |
| Reducer statistic | `--method` | string from a per-skill fixed list | The reducer statistic that aggregates values. Used by `aggregate-temporal` and `reduce` only — per-skill fixed lists, distinct values. |

### Bias correction

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q-Q mapping reference | `--qq-reference` | path | Reference Zarr whose distribution the skill maps the operation's output onto. Empirical-CDF mapping per grid cell along `--time-dim`. The reference must already be on the post-operation lat/lon grid. Used by `downscale`'s `q-q` method (required there, along with `--time-dim`). |

### Concurrency

| Concept | Flag | Value shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fetch concurrency | `--workers` | int (per-skill default) | Max size of a bounded thread pool for skills that fetch many independent items (e.g. per-station or per-day requests). For network-I/O-bound work only. Keep the default conservative to respect upstream API rate limits, and let callers lower it on throttling. A concurrency knob, not a data parameter: it must be excluded from the cache key / `weather_skills_history` args, since it changes speed, not output. |

## Rules

- **Multi-value parameters use repeated flags, not comma-separated values.** A
  skill that takes multiple values for the same concept repeats the flag
  (`-i a.zarr -i b.zarr`, `--country Kenya --country Uganda`) rather than
  accepting `a,b,c`. Applies beyond `--input`: any new multi-value flag follows
  the same form.
- **No backwards-compat aliasing.** If a flag name changes, change every caller
  in the same PR. There are no external callers to preserve.
- **Cross-skill behavior lives in `weather-skills-core`.** CLI construction,
  envelope validation, the date grammar, provenance, caching, and output
  writing come from the `@weather_skill` decorator and its modules. Skills
  never import from each other; per-skill code is domain logic only.
- **Don't reuse a canonical name for a different concept.** If you need a new
  concept, pick a new name and add it here.
